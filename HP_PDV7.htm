	<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">The traditions of the Verona Palio races, like those held in other Italian
	towns in the Medieval period, are believed to be rooted in   ancient games dating back possibly   as far as 500
	BC to  the era when the Etruscans dominated northern Italy.<BR>
	<BR>
	&quot;Public festivals, including many kinds of physical activities, formed a significant part of Etruscan culture,&quot;
	 Such Etruscan games included races involving the goading of buffaloes, which suggests early bullfighting, and
	long hazardous races both on horseback and on foot through the city.  Etruscan art shows athletes competing for
	prizes in foot races.<BR>
	<BR>
	With  a longstanding tradition of such races, it is not surprising  that well over  a thousand years  later  it
	was in Northern Italy such Palii events  featuring horse  races and  footraces as well took place in the towns
	such as Asti,  Padua, Ferrara and  Bologna. as well as in Verona,<BR>
	<BR>
	Such races were made possible by, and developed from, the  wealth and freedom that existed in those  Northern Italian
	towns and cities.  Many of the cities had  become self governing and had broken away from the Medieval feudal system.<BR>
	<BR>
	It is therefore no coincidence that the  &quot; PALIO DEL DRAPPO VERDE&quot; foot race held in Verona celebrated
	the victory of the Verona City Republic over the Counts of San Bonifazio and the Montecchi family.  The race reputedly
	dated from 1207 or  1208.  (This difference in date could be attributed to 1207 being the date of the battle, and
	1208 being the first actual footrace.)<BR>
	<BR>
	The celebratory foot race was obviously modeled on an earlier  horse race, (dating back to 1198) using the same
	course, but was open to a  wider populace. A later Italian footrace of around 1450 suggests that  there were &quot;Many
	lusty active youths&quot; who often competed in such foot races.<BR>
	<BR>
	The name of the Palio del Drappo Verde race comes from the prize that was awarded to the winner. The Italian word
	for palio comes from the Latin word Pallium meaning a  rectangular piece of cloth.<BR>
	<BR>
	Marco Polo's journeys in China led to an ever-increasing use of silk in Western Europe. As early as the twelfth
	Century. Venetian merchants traded extensively in silk and encouraged silk growers to settle in Italy. By the 13th
	century Italian silk was a significant source of trade. However it was still   was very much a luxury, and the
	prize of  silk cloth would have been<BR>
	much sought after.<BR>
	<BR>
	The Palio del Drapo Verde is remarkable because  the footrace  was held for so many centuries. The reason for this
	is almost certainly because the requirement to hold the race  was incorporated into law.<BR>
	<BR>
	The Statuto Albertino  (the Albertino codex of laws)  of 1271,  compiled for Alberto della Scala,  (which contained
	some laws which dated back several years before), stated that two races were to be held in the first Sunday of
	Lent, a horse race and a running race.<BR>
	<BR>
	The Albertino codex of laws were then re-established  by Cangrande I in 1328 made the details of the prizes  more
	specific. A green palio (the &quot;green cloth&quot; ),  would go to the winner of the footrace and a rooster to
	the last runner.<BR>
	<BR>
	A very early victory for women's lib came  with the Statuto by Giangaleazzo Visconti, which was approved in 1393.
	There was now to be  a race for the women.  The men would seek to win  a red cloth, with  the traditional rooster
	to the last runner. In the women's race, the palio verde that had previously been reserved for men, now was reassigned
	by Giangaleazzo Visconti to women.<BR>
	<BR>
	The fastest woman would receive the green cloth, the slowest would be given a rooster. The Statuto even specified
	that the running event was open to &quot;honest women, even if only one is to participate; however, if no honest
	women are available, then prostitutes would run&quot;.<BR>
	<BR>
	The male runners traditionally ran naked. This could  be a link to the ancient Etruscan  games, where those performing
	in athletic races ran naked .  Another more likely possibility is that  running naked made it impossible for opponents
	to grab at the clothing of those in front of them to pull them back, in what would have been a much more robust
	and combative race than is permitted under modern rules.<BR>
	<BR>
	It is uncertain whether women ran naked; the women's race was described as being open to &quot;honest women&quot;,
	but if not even one came forward, then it was open to prostitutes. This suggests that the women too ran naked;
	if honest women were too modest, then less modest females were to be included!<BR>
	<BR>
	From 1207 until 1450 the races were held on the First Sunday in Lent, but from 1450, after Verona came under
	the control of  Venice,  it was held on Fat Thursday - which is the Thursday before Ash Wednesday.<BR>
	<BR>
	This period in Italy from Fat Thursday (gioved&igrave; grasso) through to the Fat Tuesday (marted&igrave; grasso)
	is traditionally the time  for   staging carnivals and for eating well before the restrictions of Lent . Depending
	on the date of Easter such celebrations usually take place in January or February. The Palio races were an integral
	part of these celebrations.<BR>
	<BR>
	The cooler conditions of this time of year were preferable to the heat of an Italian summer for the runners, but
	there was a greater  chance of  wet conditions.  A report on a mid fifteenth century race in Pienza  records &quot;There
	 had been a light rain and the track was slippery. They ran naked and now one, now another was ahead and often
	one or another could be seen to<BR>
	slip and fall and roll on the ground and mud and those who had been last were now ahead.&quot;  So the event would
	often  have been more like a muddy cross country than a road race, particularly bearing in mind that down the middle
	of each street would  have run  a virtual open sewer.<BR>
	<BR>
	Fat Thursday and its carnival was a celebration for the whole community of Verona and its townsfolk were involved
	in the Palio itself. The losers were expected to tour the town, showing off their `consolation prize'. The last
	horseman would cross the city with the leg of pork tied around his horse's neck. Under  the race rules anyone could
	legally cut the rope and take the<BR>
	leg of pork.<BR>
	<BR>
	Similarly it is likely the last runner would be expected to lead his reluctant rooster by a piece of string across
	Verona  to the merriment of the townsfolk. Any prankster  would be able to cut the string and free the indignant
	fowl, which presumably would lead to free-for-all chase after the bird.<BR>
	<BR>
	The length of the Verona footrace race is documented but the course could be changed by the podest&agrave;, the
	local noble executive officer that held the city's administrative powers. The podesta could also choose where the
	race would be held.<BR>
	<BR>
	According to Indro Neri's  detailed article on the race, the course would start from the Tomba neighborhood (but
	later from the Santa Lucia neighborhood) and would wind along the city walls south of Verona, running by the entrance
	 Porta al Palio (also known as &quot;Porta Stuppa&quot; or &quot;Stupa&quot;, built by the architect Sammicheli)
	and crossing the field &quot;a mezzogiorno della citt&agrave;&quot; (south of Verona).<BR>
	<BR>
	The course was then heading back to Verona, going under the Arco dei Gavi (Gavi's arch), and continuing along Corso
	Vecchio (the old main street) to reach the Palazzo della torre a San Fermo (San Fermo tower's palace). Later the
	course would cross the current Corso to finish in piazza di Sant'Anastasia (Saint Anastasia square) at  a column
	called &quot;La meta&quot; (&quot;The end&quot;) that represented the finish line of the race.  The horse race
	was held on the same course and was of the same length of the running event.<BR>
	<BR>
	Stefano Scevaroli,  who lives in Verona, estimates this course would have been at least seven kilometres long,
	perhaps over ten kilometres. Much of the course is still in existence;  it is the return to the piazza di Sant'Anastasia
	from the Porta Palio that is unclear. The race would always finish  in the public square of Sant' Anastasia.<BR>
	<BR>
	It would seem likely that as silk gradually became less of a luxury, with the opening up of maritime trade routes
	to the east, and the development of the European silk industry, the intrinsic value of the Drappo Verde became
	 less important, and its  symbolic value increased.<BR>
	<BR>
	Maybe by the eighteenth century , the foot race  in Verona was similar to the modern day Palio horse race at Siena,
	a contest  between runners from different parts of the city for a painted silk banner.<BR>
	<BR>
	The Verona Palio footraces were held until 1797 when the Venetian Empire was conquered by Napoleon.  Following
	the signing of the Treaty of Campo Formio on  17th October, 1797   Venice became part of the Austrian-held  Kingdom
	of Lombardy-Venetia.  The Austrians took control of the city on 18th January, 1798. Venice and the cities of the
	former Venetian Empire  fell into a decline.<BR>
	<BR>
	The French Revolutionary movement was strongly  anti-clerical, and religious celebrations and carnivals would have
	been discouraged, thought by those brought to power in Verona by Napoleon, to be old fashioned and potentially
	subversive.   Thus carnival celebrations and the Palio races were no longer acceptable, and the long held traditions
	were suppressed or simply<BR>
	allowed to disappear..<BR>
	<BR>
	The Verona Palio race had lasted some 590 years, making it the distance footrace with the greatest number of  runnings
	known<BR>
	<BR>
	With the success of the Siena Palio horse races in attracting tourists to the city, perhaps  Verona should  consider
	reviving the Palio del Drappo Verde. Such popular city races have proven very successful in promoting and developing
	a distinctive identity for their host cities<BR>
	<BR>
	In 2007 it will 800 years since  The Palio del Drappo Verde race was first held; by 2017 the 600th race could be
	the focus for a great cultural and sporting event.  The longest running footrace could continue its remarkable
	duration onwards  in to the future.<BR>
	<BR>
	I would like to thank Indro Neri for his help with this article. His article on the Run the Planet website A Medieval
	race in Verona gives many important insights into the Verona race.  Don Macgregor supplied useful information on
	the Pienza Palio race. Stefano Scevaroli was very helpful in explaining details and length of the actual course
	that the runners would have taken.</FONT></P>
