<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Record keeping varies widely from country to country. Most countries do not recognize
road records. The following is an attempt to list national records using a consistent set of standards. Records
reflect performances in the ADR database. Since the ADR database only tracks runners who have met certain time
standards, there will be national records that are excluded from these lists since they do not meet the criteria
for inclusion in the ADR database.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Citizenship is determined as of the date of the race with exceptions for countries
that have since merged or split. In such cases, citizenship is assigned according to current countries. East and
West Germany are both indicated by GER; runners representing the former Soviet Union are assigned to currently
existing countries where known.. ENG, NIR, SCO, and WAL are listed as well as GBR.<br>
<br>
<a href="WG_Rec_ENG.htm">World road records</a> for women as recognized by the 
ARRS must be set in women-only competition.&nbsp; The world marks listed in this 
section were usually made in mixed competition, consistent with the national 
road records which also include mixed competition.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Record quality performances are those made on standard (loop) courses that are believed
to be accurate.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Point-to-point courses are defined as those courses whose start and finish lie more
than 30% of the race distance apart and/or whose drop exceeds 1 meter per kilometer. If the drop is less than 5
meters per kilometer, performances are considered statistically valid. Such performances are included if they are
better than the standard course mark (or if there is no standard course mark) and have an &quot;a&quot; appended
to the time, indicating these are potentially aided performances.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Performances on point-to-point courses whose drop exceeds 5 meters per kilometer
are not considered statistically valid and are not included.</FONT></P>
