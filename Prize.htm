<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">For the purposes of these lists, prize money is defined monetary awards
that are generally available to a broadly defined category of runners. As such, the prize money distribution is
generally known to the participants,</FONT><I><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica"> i.e</FONT></I><FONT SIZE="2"
FACE="Arial, Helvetica">., private arrangements between a race and a runner are not considered prize money. Monetary
awards available to a select few runners based on performance such as bonuses offered by the runner's sponsor are
not considered prize money since they are private arrangements and are not available to a broadly defined category
of runners. Likewise, appearance money is not considered prize money since these are private arrangements. Non-monetary
prizes are not considered prize money; it is generally quite difficult to assign a proper value to a non-monetary
award such as an automobile.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">Prize money does include both open and age-group awards as well as awards
based on nationality, residence (state or local), and club membership. It includes record and time incentive bonuses,
provided such awards are not private arrangements. Awards made in non-USA currencies have been converted to US$
at the prevailing exchange rate.</FONT></P>
<P class="auto-style1">Prize money won by athletes who were later disqualified 
has been removed and the prize money awards for the affected races has been 
adjusted and credited to the athletes who would have won the adjusted prize 
money amounts.&nbsp; Disqualified athletes are required to repay any awards paid 
for performances that were later disqualified.&nbsp; It is difficult to 
determine if this prize money was recovered and actually paid to those athletes 
who should have won it.&nbsp; Hence, the some of the prize money noted in this 
section may not have actually been paid to the athletes that it is credited to.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">It is often difficult to obtain prize money distributions from prize
money races. Often, publications providing race results omit any mention of prize money distributions. Some races
prefer to keep a low profile with regards to awarding prize money. With these caveats, the following prize money lists are presented.</FONT></P>
