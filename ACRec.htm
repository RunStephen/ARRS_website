<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">The following is an attempt to list all-comers records (fastest performance attained
within a country without regard for the nationality of the runner) for all nations using a consistent set of standards.
Records reflect performances in the ADR database. Since the ADR database only tracks runners who have met certain
time standards, there will be all-comers records that are excluded from these lists since they do not meet the
criteria for inclusion in the ADR database.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">All-comers records for nations are for countries as they are presently constituted.
Records for countries that have split, such as Czechoslovakia =&gt; CZE and SVK will reflect the location of the
race according to present political boundaries, e.g.races held in Prague are eligible for CZE records and not SVK
records and races held in Kosice are eligible for SVK records and not CZE records, regardless of the year in which
the race was held.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Record quality performances are those made on standard (loop) courses that are believed
to be accurate.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Point-to-point courses are defined as those courses whose start and finish lie more
than 30% of the race distance apart and/or whose drop exceeds 1 meter per kilometer. If the drop is less than 5
meters per kilometer, performances are considered statistically valid. Such performances are included if they are
better than the standard course mark (or if there is no standard course mark) and have an &quot;a&quot; appended
to the time, indicating these are potentially aided performances.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Performances on point-to-point courses whose drop exceeds 5 meters per kilometer
are not considered statistically valid and are not included.</FONT></P>
