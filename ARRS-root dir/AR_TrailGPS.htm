<br>
Until recently the difficulty of measuring a trail course to any&nbsp;degree of 
accuracy has proved a major problem.&nbsp; The advent of&nbsp;Global&nbsp;Positioning 
System (GPS) has enabled runners in the Tucson&nbsp;Trail Run Series (TTRS) to obtain 
the distance of specific trail runs, even those which are on very rocky and 
mountainous trails.&nbsp;This essentially uses a runner instead of a bicycle as the 
measuring vehicle.&nbsp; A&nbsp;serious runner will tend to run the 
shortest&nbsp;available&nbsp;route.<br>
<br>
TTTRS was started in the late 1970s by Ken Young. Ken laid out the original 
routes using the series of maps created by the Southern Arizona Hiking Club with 
the trails marked in red, including distance estimates. Ken used those estimates 
and hand-calculated climbs from the contour lines on the topographic maps. Most 
of the distances were obtained by the traditional methods that National Forest 
and National Park trail builders used for decades. When runners began to use 
handheld GPS units in the 1990s they could compare their estimates to well-known 
routes on excellent maps. This provided a “calibration standard” to help 
evaluate the accuracy of the new technology. In addition to one of the authors 
(Ross Zimmerman), Wayne Coates has done extensive GPS mapping with trails and 
Duane Arter used GPS tools to lay out the Old Pueblo 50 mile course. On the web

GPS operation depends on the handheld unit triangulating its position relative 
to the constellation of GPS satellites orbiting the earth. Typically the unit 
needs to lock onto at least 4 satellites to locate itself with decent accuracy. 
With previous generations of GPSes, this was often a problem when trees or 
cliffs blocked direct line-of-sight to the satellites. Since new radio circuits 
have come out with much better signal lock, GPS technology has become much more 
effective. <br>
<br>
Ross Zimmerman, TTRS co-administrator makes most of the maps that are provided 
to participants. He has used several makes and models of GPSes over the past 10+ 
years. Currently he uses a Garmin 60CSx, which has the newer radio and has a 
stubby external antennae.&nbsp; It almost never loses signal.&nbsp; In his study at home 
it finds 8-10 satellites.&nbsp; A GPS can determine its position at the user’s 
request, or it can automatically keep a “track log” wherein the GPS takes a 
reading at intervals which the user can specify and then keeps recalculating 
locations, distances, speed, etc. <br>
<br>
Typically, one uses a GPS in conjunction with mapping software such as the 
mapping tools from Delorme, Maptech, TopoFusion (All Windows only), National 
Geographic (Windows and Mac), and MacGPS Pro (Mac only). &nbsp; GPS manufacturers 
also may have software, like Garmin’s Mapsource. In all cases, one attaches the 
GPS unit to the USB or serial port of the computer and transfers data into the 
mapping software. <br>
<br>
Until recently the 60CSx was one of Garmin's top of the line consumer models.&nbsp; 
Garmin is the handheld GPS market leader, with a reputation for accuracy and 
ease of use. Other well-regarded manufacturers include Magellan and Lowrance. 
(Newer Garmin GPS models with more features came out a few weeks ago, but they 
appear to have the same radio receiver.) &nbsp; The 60CSx is oriented for the 
hardcore GPS user; Garmin has other models that are smaller and oriented toward 
runners (wrist wearable Forerunner series) and cyclists (Edge).&nbsp; The model 
numbers in those lines ending in x05 have the newer radios.&nbsp; The 60CSx probably 
still holds signal better.&nbsp; The sport-specific Garmins come with PC 
software for analysing your GPS data in ways that are useful to your sport. <br>
<br>
When Ross undertakes a GPS run or ride, he clears the counters and the track 
logs on his GPS unit. Typically, he keeps his on the counters displays. This 
tells him things like how far, how fast, how high, how much time, etc. He uses 
the GPS for road and mountain bike rides as well as runs. This has provided 
another useful set of comparisons, since his bikes have their own “bike 
computers” which count wheel rotations. For example, at the Death Ride in the 
Sierra Nevada of California, the event is claimed to be 129 miles long. Both 
Ross’ bike computer and GPS calculate the distance at 125 miles.<br>
<br>
As mentioned, the accuracy of your GPS unit depends on the number of satellites 
you have a lock on.&nbsp; Three is bare minimum for 2D, 4 for 3D.&nbsp; With a good set of 
satellites, accuracy can be within 10-20 feet of true location. When Ross 
finishes a run, he turns off the track logging straight away.&nbsp; (He found when he 
tried to save a track and use a “Saved Track” for his maps that Garmins only 
save a digest of the full track log.) &nbsp; <br>
<br>
He has found the estimates directly from the GPS are can't always be trusted for 
reasons he is still trying to work out. The calculation produced by the GPS unit 
assumes you're moving on the smooth curve of sphere, not a mountain.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
It is likely that in the older units which had more data jitter, with variable 
readings, Garmin was using a smoothing filter to compensate for aberrant data 
points. This could affect the readings seriously on switchbacks.&nbsp; Newer, more 
sophisticated units can now also calculate total feet of climb, however probably 
with some extra feet due to jitter.&nbsp; It’s very important to have a GPS with a 
barometric altimeter if you want accurate elevation reading. GPS-only elevation 
estimates are notoriously inaccurate. Even with the barometric altimeter, there 
is some scatter to the GPS altitude data, resulting in overestimates of climb 
and descent. Ross is working with Larry James, the author of MacGPS Pro, on this 
issue.<br>
<br>
After completing a run or ride, Ross notes the GPS tripmeter value, but 
downloads the GPS track log into the computer. Newer GPSes have USB ports.&nbsp; 
Maptech Terrain Navigator and MacGPS Pro typically compute slightly different, 
usually shorter, trip distances than the built-in tripmeter of the GPS. Both are 
simply adding<br>
up all the track point to track point distances.<br>
<br>
So in addition to an array of choices for the GPS itself, one has lots of 
computer mapping software choices. That could be an entire series of articles. 
One differentiator is the ability to edit your individual data points. If that’s 
important consider Topofusion. If you’re a Mac user, MacGPS Pro lets you supply 
your own<br>
maps from multiple sources. <br>
<br>
One issue that concerns some people is the loss of signal through tree cover. 
Both tree canopy and canyon walls can block satellites.&nbsp; When your GPS loses 
signal, usually the unit will bleep. If it is swiftly removed from its holster 
and held over head it will often lock back on with a further beep. Switchbacks 
can compound<br>
the issue, especially if they are under trees or between cliffs. In Ross’ 
experience, this problem is vastly improved with the new model GPSes with the 
new radio receivers. But if you’d like hear about Dave Patten’s tests with an 
older model eTrex go to this link—

<br>
Until we get to the next generation of GPS satellites and associated handheld 
receivers, the technology is still some way from the precision of calibrated 
bike and steel tape measurements.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
If the short course prevention factor currently used for road courses were 
doubled, [from one&nbsp; metre per kilometre of distance of the race course, to two 
metres per&nbsp; kilometre,&nbsp;over the marathon distance from 42 m to&nbsp;84 m,] 
that&nbsp;should be sufficient to insure the course to be at least the advertised 
distance. If several runners in a particular race used&nbsp;GPS&nbsp;technology, 
particularly combined with good computer mapping software that&nbsp;could give a very 
good indication of the actual distance of the&nbsp;course.&nbsp; Such ongoing 
re-evaluation&nbsp;would take care of any&nbsp;year-to-year variations in the course. In 
the discussion list TTR_AZ used for the Tucson Trail Run Series, past run 
comparisons of GPS readings are a frequent topic.&nbsp; The GPS gives total distance, 
splits, times, elevations, total&nbsp; climb&nbsp; and descent, and all<br>
sorts of other figures.&nbsp; From this a detailed&nbsp; profile of the course can be 
produced, and&nbsp;much of the uncertainty of&nbsp;trail running can be resolved. This 
would greatly aid in determining whether&nbsp;great performances have been&nbsp;set, or if 
the course was just short.<br>
