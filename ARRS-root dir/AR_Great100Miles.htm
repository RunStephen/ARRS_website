Distance running can be a fairly predictable sport; runners set off at an even 
pace to finish in a time close to that they have achieved before. Sometimes 
however, a runner emerges who is touched by genius, who seeks to break the 
mould.&nbsp; Over thirty-five years ago, such a runner produced his greatest 
performance, a performance that still is regarded with awe by ultrarunners 
across the world, not just for the times achieved, but the sheer audacity of the 
run.<br>
<br>
On October 25, 1975, at Tipton in England, perhaps the greatest 100mile race 
ever staged took place. It was a British Road Runners Club promotion held three 
weeks after the London to Brighton Race. All 18 competitors had been very 
carefully selected from a far greater number who had wanted to run, and although 
only three of these had previously competed in a track “100 miler,” all were 
vastly experienced ultrarunners.<br>
<br>
The two most experienced entrants were probably Ron Bentley, the then holder of 
the 24 hour track record 259.603 km, although until the last moment he was a 
doubtful starter because of injury, and New Zealander Siegfried Bauer, who had 
averaged 124 km a day in running the 1,600 km from Pretoria to Cape Town and 114 
km miles a day on a 2125 km run of the length of New Zealand.&nbsp; Bauer had 
also run 6:56:08 at the Unna 100 Km in Germany in early September. But for many, 
the most intriguing competitor was Cavin Woodward, who had won the Brighton in 
5:12:07, just over a minute outside the course record, and who had also set a 
new world best for the 30 mile track event earlier in the year.<br>
<br>
Before the race Woodward had looked at Derek Kay’s splits in setting the world 
track best for 100 miles (11:56:56), and decided that such even paced running 
was not his style.&nbsp; The Woodward method of running a race was to go off as 
fast as he could for as long as he could: “No matter what pace you start at, you 
will slow eventually, so start at a fast pace which will give you momentum.”&nbsp; 
He added, “The reason why I go out in front is because I want to run my own 
race.&nbsp; If you are in a bunch, and the front runners stop, you have to chop 
your stride. In front I can speed up when I feel like it, slow down when I come 
to a hill, judge the traffic, and do what I want to do.”<br>
<br>
However, even he had his doubts about his ability to blast 100 miles from the 
front.&nbsp; As he said later, “My one big problem with this race was I did not 
know if I could cover the distance.&nbsp; The longest race I had run was the 
Brighton; I knew I could run 50 miles, so I decided to go for as fast a time as 
possible for 50 miles and then ‘hang on’ as long as I could to see if I could 
cover the 100 mile course.”&nbsp; So he devised three schedules.&nbsp; The first 
would break the world record of 11:56:56 by 20 minutes; the second would break 
it by five minutes; and the third would break John Tarrant’s British record of 
12:31.<br>
<br>
The first schedule had ten mile [16km] splits of 55, 59, 62, 64, and 65 minutes 
for the first 50 miles, giving a 50 mile time of 5:05. Woodward would see how 
things went, and if possible try to break the world record of 5:01:01.&nbsp; 
Woodward used a carbo loading diet prior to the race.&nbsp; He ate kippers, 
grapefruit and so on for three days and then ate normally with potatoes, 
sandwiches and the like.&nbsp; During the race he was to use the electrolyte 
drink supplied by the organizers, in this case Accolade, the race sponsors.<br>
<br>
A dull and misty dawn broke to reveal a scene reminiscent of some medieval 
tournament, with brightly coloured tents that would shelter the many handlers 
ready to bring aid to the present day warriors who would be fighting out on the 
yielding but soft cinder track.&nbsp; The day was never to be warmer than 12 
degrees C —not really warm enough for comfortable running.<br>
<br>
When the race started, Woodward took off like a marathon runner, a speed that 
appeared to surprise the timekeepers and recorders as they sat in their drafty 
stand.&nbsp; Even those who were used to his blitz starts had figured he would 
treat an event four times the marathon with at least some circumspection.<br>
<br>
The first mile was passed in 5:19, five miles[8km] in 27:49, ten miles[16km] in 
56:27, 15 miles in 1:25:22, and 20 miles [32km] in 1:54:26.&nbsp; At this point, 
Woodward was running at almost ten and one half miles [17.5km] per hour, and his 
very fast initial pace had apparently seduced the majority of the field to 
respond.&nbsp; Fifteen of the 18 at 20 miles were inside a world record 
schedule. (But that is not too unusual in an ultra race of that duration.&nbsp; 
Despite their most earnest pre-race pledges, male ultrarunners tend to go off 
too fast!)<br>
<br>
When Woodward reached 20 miles, he was 26 minutes ahead of the even paced 
schedule to break the existing record, and his lead over the field was 16 
minutes, with Martin Thompson of Australia in second place in 2:10:37, Derek 
Funnell third just over three minutes back, and Tom O’Reilly less than a minute 
behind him.&nbsp; They were followed by a group two minutes later consisting of 
Siegfried Bauer, Fred Howell, Bill Carr, Alan Richards, and John Berry. Woodward 
reached the marathon point in 2:31:22.<br>
<br>
By 30 miles [48.2km], Woodward was now two minutes and ten seconds inside his 
fastest schedule, so things were looking good.&nbsp; He had a few twinges in his 
right calf, and shoe trouble, but nothing major.&nbsp; The 50km mark was passed 
in under 3:01 – this is in a race that was scheduled as well over three times 
50km!<br>
<br>
By 40 miles [64.3km] he was 3:42 inside schedule, so it was set up for the next 
ten miles. Laps of 1:36 were planned for the next 20 laps, and 1:33 for the last 
20 laps; he covered 80km in under 4:57 and reached 50 miles in 4:58:53 to be the 
first man to run faster than ten miles [16km] an hour for 50 miles.<br>
<br>
Woodward was relieved to have broken the 50 mile record; it meant that the 
effort had been worthwhile.&nbsp; Something had been achieved even if he did not 
succeed in breaking the 100 mile world best.&nbsp; He relaxed a little, knowing 
that he could take two hours longer to complete the second 50 miles than he had 
the first, and still break the world 100 mile mark.&nbsp; He pushed on for three 
more miles before he made his first toilet stop.&nbsp; He had been determined 
that he would not do that until after 50 miles.&nbsp; Tom O’Reilly was second 
through the 50 mile point with 5:32:49, having overtaken Martin Thompson 
(5:45:20).<br>
<br>
Woodward’s schedule for the next 50 miles was ten mile [16km] splits of 74, 75, 
76, 80, and 86 minutes. In the first 6 hours Woodward had run 94.54 km. He took 
another stop to check on a blister at 59 miles but decided that it would last 
out to the finish.<br>
<br>
By 60 miles Woodward was nine minutes inside his fastest schedule, and pushed on 
to take the 100 km world best with a time of 6:25:28, taking a massive 34 
minutes off the previous best mark which had been set in Germany only the week 
before. (The RRC had only just decided to start recognizing metric ultra 
distances, and Woodward was not really aware there was a 100km world best. )<br>
<br>
Thirty years later such 100km times are still rare; only one runner has bettered 
it on the track.&nbsp; Reflecting on his run, 20 years later,Woodward felt that 
he could easily have improved on the 6:25, remembering his various stops, but 
that might have had long term consequences for his final 100 mile time.).&nbsp; 
In second place, Tom O’Reilly had produced the then third best track mark of 
alltime of 7:00:18.<br>
<br>
By 70 miles [112km] Woodward had fallen back to six minutes inside his fastest 
schedule, but still covered 119km in 8 hours.&nbsp; Following a further stop at 
78 miles, Woodward was now only two minutes inside schedule.&nbsp; By the time 
80 miles [130km] was passed he was paying the price of his earlier speed and 
there was a marked drop in his pace.<br>
<br>
There was just the chance that Tom O’Reilly, who was gradually reducing the 
distance between himself and the leader, would provide an upset that would have 
been unthinkable earlier in the day.&nbsp; However, O’Reilly himself was having 
problems.&nbsp; He had three bad spells between 65 and 80 miles, and stopped 
each time. On the final occasion, the tough veteran, Ron Bentley had said to him 
as he passed, “Get going.”&nbsp; He did, and was not to stop again until he 
reached the finish.<br>
<br>
Dr John Brotherhood took a sample of Woodward’s urine, decided that he was 
beginning to suffer from fatigue, and advised him that his temperature was 
dropping too fast and that more clothing was needed.&nbsp; An additional Tshirt, 
a pullover, and rugby shirt, plus tracksuit bottoms, started to warm him up, and 
eased the pins and needles that he had begun to suffer in his arms, perhaps 
because of his high arm action.<br>
<br>
Despite these problems, Woodward took the world 150 km best with 10:44:55, and 
from then began to pick up his pace, with the end in sight. From 90 miles he was 
running sub 5:00 minutes kilometres. From 95 miles he pushed hard, all the time 
coming closer to his fastest schedule. His last mile was 7:07, and he broke the 
world record by 18:02 with 11:38:54, bettering Derek Kay’s record set in Durban, 
South Africa, in 1972.<br>
<br>
Woodward had taken 6:40:01 for his second 50 miles, a differential of 1:41:08 
between the two 50 mile splits.&nbsp; His 50km splits were 3:01, 6:25:28, 
10:44:55, with 54 minutes for his last 10.93 km. Mentally he had kept going, and 
coped with the repetition of track running by checking his lap times and working 
them out.<br>
<br>
A large crowd gathered to cheer the winner in the final stages, but now he had 
finished, the other competitors had to push on steadily into the darkness for 
another four hours or more.&nbsp; Tom O’Reilly finished 23 minutes 28 seconds 
behind for second place, (taking third place on the then world alltime track 
rankings), and in third, a further 32 minutes, 19 seconds after came local 
runner Bill Carr, who had run a very even pace while other runners had had their 
good and bad patches.&nbsp; The rest of the field came in at regular intervals 
until Bob Jeans finished in 13th place, 12 minutes inside the tough 16 hour time 
limit. The final results were:<br>
<br>
1. Cavin Woodward 11:38:54<br>
2. Tom O’Reilly 12:02:32<br>
3. Bill Carr 12:34:51<br>
4. Martin Thompson,AUS 12:42:50<br>
5. Fred Howell 12:49:29<br>
6. Alan Richards 12:59:48<br>
7. Ron Bentley 13:29:56<br>
8. Siegfried Bauer,NZL 13:31:55<br>
9. Derek Funnell 13:49:24<br>
10. Bob Meadowcroft 14:42:30<br>
11. John Berry 14:55:38<br>
12. Ken Shaw 15:35:44<br>
13. Bob Jeans 15:47:58<br>
<br>
Woodward commented afterwards, “I was told before the race that the one thing I 
could not do was blast off with 5m30s miles [3m43s kms].&nbsp; Of course I did, 
and I broke the world 50 mile record.&nbsp; Then I heard, ‘He will now drop out 
somewhere in the race, so who will break the 100 mile record?’&nbsp; I went on 
and broke the 100 mile record as well . . . It was a great sense of achievement 
when I did do it, as I had had doubts.”<br>
<br>
“I did not want to prove everybody had been wrong. I proved that it could be 
done.&nbsp; I hope I have altered the outlook of some runners.&nbsp; I hope I 
proved that running even paced is not the only way of winning races and breaking 
records.&nbsp; I would like to think that if a runner wants to try and run 
ultras fast right from the start against the wishes of his coach or trainer he 
could convincingly argue that that was the way Cavin Woodward did it.”<br>
<br>
If Woodward had not run the 100 miles in his own way, it is possible that people 
would still be saying that the only way to run a 100 miles is to start slow, and 
pace yourself through the race.&nbsp; Woodward had no injuries following the 
race, and in fact represented his club in the Birmingham League races the 
following weekend, being one of their six scoring runners!<br>
