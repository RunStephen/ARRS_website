</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><BR>
During much of the Georgian era - 1760 to around 1820s - we find slight<BR>
evidence of contact between English and overseas runners, just occasional<BR>
references like those to the great Levi Whitehead winning the five Queen<BR>
Anne's guineas from a field of ten including 'the famous Indian' and 'Long<BR>
Joe' failing in an attempt on 10 miles in 58 minutes in 1794 after beating<BR>
'the famous Spaniard'.<BR>
<BR>
Around the time of the first gymnastic craze we do begin to glimpse a<BR>
growing international dimension to competitive athletics. It is this<BR>
development, particularly through English pedestrianism's links with<BR>
continental Europe and North America, which we here attempt to illustrate in<BR>
the following survey covering the period 1826 to 1878.<BR>
<BR>
1826. John Berry of Lancashire beat the German velocipedist, Maurice Rummel,<BR>
over 10 miles on the Uxbridge road from the first milestone near Kensington<BR>
Gardens to the sixth beyond Acton and back. Many foreigners attended and for<BR>
the first three miles the roadside was packed with spectators, the Germans<BR>
backing their man freely though in small amounts. Rummel took an early lead<BR>
but Berry caught him at Acton and on the return stretch nearing Notting Hill<BR>
bounded, away to win by 30 yards. 'All the spectators whether English or<BR>
foreign, admitted a better contested match had never been witnessed'.<BR>
Rummell, a very fine active youth - small, but symmetrical person', had<BR>
previously won a wager for the Prince de Leon by covering 2&frac12; French leagues<BR>
(almost 7 miles) in 36 minutes (on his velocipede?).<BR>
<BR>
1827. At Sunbury Rummel lost to Berry over 5 miles and to James Wantling<BR>
over 250 yards. The last defeat is scarcely surprising since Wantling, at<BR>
least by reputation, was the top sprinter of the pre-Victorian era. Later<BR>
in, the year, principally because of the extreme heat, Rummel failed in his<BR>
attempt to run 10 miles in one hour on the Lewes road.<BR>
<BR>
1827. Robert Skipper, long-distance walker, beat 'the celebrated Frenchman'<BR>
in Paris. For Skipper, see John Goulstone's monograph John Townsend, the<BR>
Sussex Pedestrian (1999), note 1.<BR>
<BR>
1828. George Hall from the Potteries won a hard-fought 350-yard, race by<BR>
half a yard against Dufont for 2,000 a-side at St Germains near Paris,<BR>
before 'a numerous attendance of the English residents'. Doubtless many of<BR>
the latter were connected with the Paris Cricket Club (in 1829 called the<BR>
Albion club and an English cricket club) whose membership in 1828 included<BR>
'60 persons of the first families in the French capital' who attended in<BR>
force its matches on the plains of Monceaux.<BR>
<BR>
1828. The French velocipedist, John Joseph Grandserre, offered to run (ride<BR>
a velocipe?) 19 times round the Inner Circle In Regents Park, an estimated<BR>
19 miles, in 2 hours. A few months later John Shepherd beat him with<BR>
remarkable ease over a 10-mile course around a circle, a 'third of a mile<BR>
round, staked out at Lord's'. At the end of the 20th lap Shepherd was half a<BR>
mile in front and occasionally drew up to take some wine and water. Seeing<BR>
this, Grandserre put in a terrific burst to go 50 yards ahead. Then Shepherd<BR>
passed him with the rapidity of lightning, and at the end of his 10 miles<BR>
went to the adjoining house for a nap. Those who had betted on 'the<BR>
Frenchman' thereupon claimed he had run one lap short. When told about this,<BR>
'out of bed he jumped, ran out of the house, and proceeded round the circle<BR>
for the thirty-first time, and before his opponent had completed his<BR>
twenty-ninth round' (for further details see John Goulstone's 'John<BR>
Shepherd, The Yorkshire Phenomenon', Sports History 9 (1986), pp. 7-9).<BR>
<BR>
1831. Augustus do Berenger (said to be Prussian-born) founded the Stadium at<BR>
Chelsea. It was intended to cover foot racing and leaping. Also, 'leaping,<BR>
jumping, &amp;c' (a distinction left unexplained) were on the programme of its<BR>
projected 'Olympic Festival' in 1832. But so far as one can tell, track and<BR>
field never featured at his 'school of athletes' (see John Goulstone's<BR>
pamphlet, The Chelsea Stadium or British National Arena, 1831-1843, 1999).<BR>
1837. Pedestrian Challenge from France issued by 'Bipedis' to Burn or Fuller<BR>
to walk 10 miles at Boulogne for 2,000f - Burn evens, but Fuller 'I expect<BR>
to give my man (at present in Paris) two minutes'.<BR>
<BR>
1839. The German Henry Wolfe or Wolff challenged any man in Birmingham at<BR>
one mile. He was accepted by, and lost to, William Sheppard, one of the<BR>
great milers of the 1840s.<BR>
<BR>
1842. A match staged between a Kentish runner and one from Calais at<BR>
Tilmanstone, eight miles from Dover.<BR>
<BR>
1843. Foot racing for the last nine months has been very fashionable in<BR>
Paris, and a groom known as Flying Ben 'has often thrown down the gauntlet<BR>
to all Paris'. Numerous tradesmen, mostly from Nottingham and Sheffield,<BR>
'towns standing high in reputation for pedestrianism', undertook to find a<BR>
man from the gas-works to run the groom at 100 yards for 100f in the Bois de<BR>
Boulogne. The 'Gasman', trained by a celebrated pedestrian then living in<BR>
Paris won before a considerable number of French and English amateurs. 'The<BR>
French were highly delighted with the sport, and have promised their support<BR>
upon future occasions'. On Christmas Day, Flying Ben lost by 20 yards in the<BR>
Bois de Boulogne, over one mile for 200f, to a lad under the superintendence<BR>
of 'the Old London Pedestrian'.<BR>
<BR>
1844. The 'sporting landlord', Bob Cowans, arranged a match in which the<BR>
Rochechorcott Gas Man, beat 'Bob Logic' for 200f by 6 yards in 150 in the<BR>
Bois de Boulogne on 7 January (Sunday, a favourite day for amusements in<BR>
France).<BR>
<BR>
1844. The 'perseverance and exertions with the nobility and, gentry in [sic]<BR>
behalf of athletic sports' of 'an old London professor', now in Paris,<BR>
succeeded in raising a prize of 200f to be run for (distance, one mile) by<BR>
persons of all countries, who have resided at least six months within ten<BR>
miles of Paris. Prizes were given by a sporting English lord and his<BR>
friends, with a 10f sweepstakes, for a mile race in the Bois de Boulogne<BR>
watched by several members of the Jockey Club 'and other patrons of athletic<BR>
amusements' - won by an English lad in 5 minutes 50 seconds, with a<BR>
Frenchman, considered the first runner in France, second and a groom third.<BR>
<BR>
1844. A 2-mile race in the Bois de Boulogne announced for pedestrians<BR>
resident at least 6 months in Paris for 100f plus a 20f sweepstakes payable<BR>
to Mr Cootes, the second runner to have his money refunded.<BR>
<BR>
1846. English foot races, in the Champs d'Elysees and Bois de Boulogne,<BR>
'created a great deal of interest among the French and English residents'.<BR>
<BR>
1847. Paris is rapidly becoming 'a perfect new market in sporting affairs<BR>
among the working Englishman, in foot racing, horse racing, cricketing, &amp;c.'<BR>
.<BR>
1856. George Frost the 'Suffolk Stag' beat Antonio Genaro 'the celebrated<BR>
Spanish pedestrian', at the New Surrey Pedestrian Ground, Wandsworth - a<BR>
4-hour race which partook somewhat of a national character, the<BR>
nimble-footed son of Hispania having been warmly taken by the hand, and<BR>
spiritedly patronised, by some of his fellow-countrymen residing in the<BR>
metropolis. Genaro arrived in a cloak and a blue cap, embroidered Genaro<BR>
Andarin Espanol (Genaro the Spanish Runner) and surmounted by the crown of<BR>
Spain. 'The peculiarity of his gait, unusual to an English eye, struck<BR>
everyone; he did not lift his feet more than 2 or 3 inches and let them<BR>
descend quite flatly upon the ground' in short rapid steps. He gave up after<BR>
the 14th mile in 1 hour 38 minutes 2 seconds, with Frost 11 laps ahead. For<BR>
full details see Sports Quarterly Magazine 19 (1981), pp. 19-21.<BR>
<BR>
1861. Capt. William Henry Patten Saunders matched against M. Gambiere of<BR>
France for 2,500f a-side in 'the Great Running Match for the Championship of<BR>
France' near Paris. Gambiere forfeited when he heard of Saunders' trial<BR>
time. The Captain was styled the undefeated European Champion, having<BR>
contended victoriously for 'the sash' in Russia, Spain, Austria, Prussia and<BR>
England. His Russian race was against 'the Tartar Chief', believed<BR>
invincible in the eastern Russian Empire. When brought to Moscow, however,<BR>
Saunders 'astonished the Muscovites' by winning over 2 miles with ease in 9<BR>
minutes 18 seconds. For his career as an athlete, steeplechase jockey,<BR>
swimmer, swordsman, big-game hunter, yachtsman, bull-fighter, political<BR>
theorist and statistician, poet, novelist and claimed 'master of Coptic<BR>
lore' see Sports History 2 (1982), pp. 18-22.<BR>
<BR>
1862. International athletics meeting on Bonn cricket ground held under the<BR>
auspices of the English residents. The competitors, mostly students at Bonn<BR>
University, came from France, Germany, Russia, Poland, Hungary, Greece and<BR>
North and South America as well as from Britain (cf. Sports Quarterly<BR>
Magazine 18 (1981), pp. 5-6).<BR>
<BR>
1862. Moorex 'the Italian giant' began a 1,000 miles in 1,000 hours walk at<BR>
Warren House, Lindley Moor (information: P. Lovesey).<BR>
<BR>
1862. The Illustrated Sporting News published a portrait of William Birks as<BR>
'Champion Pedestrian of France'. He followed an early running career in<BR>
Nottinghamshire (with a win over Seward at Trent Bridge in 1847), then lived<BR>
in Calais (by 1851), Radford, Nottingham and Oxford before becoming landlord<BR>
of the Nottingham Castle, Calais, by 1862.<BR>
<BR>
1877. George Hazael beat the Italian Achille Bargozzi, a native of Forl&igrave; and<BR>
self-styled champion runner of France and Italy, who claimed to have run 50<BR>
miles in 6 hours. 'The International Running Match' over 30 miles for &pound;50<BR>
was held at Lillie Bridge with Bargozzi retiring within 50 yards of his 15th<BR>
mile, five laps behind Hazael who completed 20 miles - in the then record 1<BR>
hour, 57 minutes, 27 seconds - before being declared the winner. It was<BR>
actually Hazael who at Islington's Agricultural Hall in 1879, first broke 6<BR>
hours for 50 miles. He afterwards ran in America where in Madison Square<BR>
Garden in 1882 he also became the first to complete 600 miles in 6 days. In<BR>
1885 he installed a running track behind his hotel in Brooklyn.<BR>
